    <h1>THREE <strong>RICHES</strong> ANIMALS IN THE WORLD!</h1>

<div>
    <h2>1. Gunther</h2>
      <img src="Gunther.png" alt="Dog"/>
      <p>“The worlds richest dog is Gunther IV. With a wealth of <strong>$375 million</strong> he is living life in Miami. Gunther IV actually lives in a home that once belonged to Madonna that was purchased for $7.5 million. It all started when a German countess passed and left her money for pet Gunther III. The money for the dog was managed by trusties. They even invested some of the original amount near $100 million to help bring it to the whopping amount today.”</p>

    <h2>2. Toby</h2>
      <img src="Toby.png" alt="White Dog"/>
      <p>“Toby Rimes is a mythical poodle with an estimated net worth of <strong>$92 million</strong>. It is allegedly descended from a poodle of the same name who was owned by New York City millionaire Ella Wendel in 1931. When Ella died, she allegedly left her dog an amount between $30 million to $80 million. All of that dog’s descendants were supposedly named Toby Rimes and inherited the money. This story is an urban legend, although there was a real dog named Tobey.”</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>3. Blackie</h2>
      <img src="Blackie.png" alt="Black Cat"/>
      <p>“Blackie, the aptly named black cat owned by British recluse Ben Rea, became the Guinness Book of World Records “Wealthiest Cat” in 2011. After his death in 1988, Rea bequeathed his <<strong>$12.5 million</strong> fortune to Blackie, the last surviving of the 15 cats he shared his mansion with. The millionaire antiques dealer left nothing to his family members, but split the rest of his wealth between three cat charities, with the instruction to look after his beloved pet. No one seems to know where Blackie is today…probably relaxing on his own private island somewhere!”</p>
